# 05 Microswimmer prototype

This is my first implementation of a microswimmer; it consists of a circular object with boundary conditions such that fluid is pulled back from either side. This results in a net momentum transfer to the fluid and, therefore, swimming. Two examples are shown; one with water ($`\nu = 0.890~(\mu \mathrm{m})^2/(\mu \mathrm{s})`$), and one with a fluid of low viscosity ($`\tau / \Delta t = 1.1 ~ \Rightarrow ~ \nu = 0.002~(\mu \mathrm{m})^2/(\mu \mathrm{s})`$).
